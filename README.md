OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT : Speech Recognition System

Overview: Speech Recognition System
üéØ Objective:
To develop a speech recognition system that takes a short audio clip as input and accurately transcribes the spoken content into text. This showcases how voice inputs can be processed and understood using machine learning and natural language technologies.

üõ†Ô∏è Key Activities:
Collect Audio Input:

Use a pre-recorded .wav audio file (e.g., audio.wav).

Ensure audio is clear and in English for accurate transcription.

Pre-process Audio:

Load the audio using Python.

Prepare it for recognition (noise reduction, trimming, etc. if needed).

Speech-to-Text Conversion:

Use a recognizer (like Google Web Speech API via SpeechRecognition library).

Convert audio to a string of text.

Display Output:

Show the recognized text on console or store it in a file.

Optionally, convert the text output into an image for documentation.

üíª Technologies Used:
Category	Tools / Libraries
Language	Python
Speech Recognition	SpeechRecognition library
Audio Handling	PyAudio, .wav files
Output Formatting	PIL for image-based output
Platform	VS Code or any Python IDE
Optional Tools	Google Speech API (backend)
